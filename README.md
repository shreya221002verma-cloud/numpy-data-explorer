NumPy Data Explorer Project
# NumPy Data Explorer

## Objective
To explore NumPy fundamentals such as array creation, indexing, slicing,
mathematical operations, reshaping, broadcasting, and performance comparison
with Python lists.

- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

The project demonstrates that NumPy provides faster and more efficient
numerical computation compared to traditional Python lists.
